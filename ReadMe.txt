I notice you mentioned C#, but this project is actually set up with React, TypeScript, and Vite. I'll help you create a trending finance-focused website that will be great for a portfolio, just using these technologies instead. Let me plan out a beautiful and modern design that's perfect for showcasing your skills.

Design Inspiration:

Modern fintech apps like Stripe, Wise, and Robinhood
Clean, professional aesthetics with a focus on data visualization
Subtle animations for enhanced user experience
Glass-morphism effects for a contemporary feel
For this first version, I'll create:

A hero section with animated statistics
Key financial metrics display
A clean, interactive chart
Modern card components for feature highlights
Color Palette & Style:

Primary: Deep navy (#1E293B)
Accent: Electric blue (#3B82F6)
Success: Emerald (#10B981)
Warning: Amber (#F59E0B)
Background: Clean white with subtle gradients
Font: Inter for modern fintech feel
Subtle glass effects and soft shadows
Let's implement this beautiful design:
